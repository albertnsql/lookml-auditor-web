"""
Validator: Orphaned Objects
----------------------------
Detects:
  1. Views not referenced by ANY explore (orphaned views)
  2. Explores whose base view does not exist (zombie explores)
     — already caught by broken_references, but we surface the explore-level orphan

These are separate from broken references — an orphaned view is structurally
valid but potentially dead code. We flag as INFO (advisory).
